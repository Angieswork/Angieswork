# Welcome to My GitHub Universe 🌌🚀

In this universe, stars (repos) are born and abandoned frequently! Each one represents a glimpse into my journey through the cosmos of code.

## The Galaxies You'll Visit:
- 🪐 **Planet Python** - Full of scripts that actually run. Usually.
- ☄️ **Asteroid C** - Random chunks of C code floating aimlessly.
- 🌠 **Nebulae of Ideas** - Where projects sparkle with potential but fade away before becoming fully formed.

### Astronaut Survival Guide:
- Bring snacks for the long journey.
- Beware of black holes (projects without READMEs).
- Feel free to contribute and add your own stardust to the cosmos! 💫

Boldly go where not many have gone before... mostly because it’s chaotic out here. 🛸👾
